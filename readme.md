#Todo List

Create a todo list app using HTML, JS, and the CSS file `todos.css` in this directory.  Your app should look and function like the following GIF:


* A user can hit enter in the text input to add a new todo
* A user can click on the "Add Todo" button to add a new todo
* Make sure the app looks just like the following gif.  Use the CSS to figure out what element types, classnames, and id's you may need to use.
